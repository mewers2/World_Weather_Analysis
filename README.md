# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is a data analysis for a travel technology company called PlanMyTrip that specializes in internet related services in the hotel and lodging industry.  The purpose of the project is to collect data through APIs and present it on the company user interface search page.  The data should be presented in a way that the customer can submit weather criteria for their desired places to travel and then filter the data based on the submitted criteria. The customer can choose up to four cities to create a travel itinerary and then using the Google Maps Directions API, the app will create a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map displaying the cities on the itinerary.  The end result is to find the customer's ideal hotel in their most-desired place(s) to travel.
